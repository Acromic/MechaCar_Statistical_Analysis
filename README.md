Out of vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance. Only vehicle length provided a non random amount.

Total summary datafram.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

I think expenses would be a great study. With rising car and gas prices consumers are looking into saving money.
Is the technology in the Mechacar vs competition that much better?
I think you could test.
* fuel efficency
* engine type
* years the cars are owned before they start breaking down.

Null hypothesis: Based off the findings is there a difference with the newer technology or the same?
Alternative Hypothesis: In which ways are these findings not equal.

Id test outside of regulary maintenance (oil changes, filters, ect) which of the engines have a better life span. Which use fuel more efficency like miles driven, terrain driven. Miles and terrain type would be needed to check for statistics.
